Purpose of the Code

This project implements two fuadaniental searching algorithms.

1. Birary Search: Efficiently finds the position of a target element in a sorted list.

2. Linear Search: Iterates through the list to find the target element.

Linear Search:

Best Case. O(1)

Worst Case: O(n)

Time Complexity

Binary Search:

Best Case: O(1)

Worst Case: O(logn)
